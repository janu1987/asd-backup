The `videos/` folder is a template to hold the sessions videos that the user uploads*

The pattern of the videos is: "<Patient's name>_<Session date>.mp4"

For example:
    Patient: Alexandre Soli Soares
    Date: 2022/11/03
    Video name:  "Alexandre-Soli-Soares_2022-11-03.mp4"


*The videos are only saved in this folder if the user decides to add the Session to the Database
